## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name | Focus | Est. Days | Status |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **1** | [Audio Engine](phase1-audio-engine.md) | Rust audio engine, crossfade, DSP pipeline, Icecast streaming | ~30 | ✅ Complete |
| **2** | [Operator UI](phase2-operator-ui.md) | React dark console UI, deck panels, waveform, crossfade/DSP dialogs | ~25 | ✅ Complete |
| **3** | [Automation & Scheduling](phase3-automation-scheduling.md) | AutoDJ, rotation rules, show scheduler, GAP killer, request policy | ~22 | ✅ Complete |
| **4** | [Streaming & Encoders](phase4-streaming-encoders.md) | Multiple encoders, file recording, live listen, listener stats | ~20 | ✅ Complete |
| **5** | [Scripting & Advanced Audio](phase5-scripting-advanced-audio.md) | Lua scripting engine, mic/voice FX, de-esser, reverb, voice tracking | ~18 | ✅ Complete |
| **6** | [DBE Gateway Integration](phase6-dbe-gateway-integration.md) | Desktop↔gateway bridge, AutoPilot, remote DJ, live talk | ~13 | ✅ Complete |
| **7** | [Analytics & Operations](phase7-analytics-operations.md) | Play history, listener graphs, event log, system health, reports | ~17 | ✅ Complete |

**Total estimated effort: ~145 developer-days**

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Audio Engine)
    └─► Phase 2 (UI — needs engine commands to wire up)
    └─► Phase 3 (Automation — needs deck control + queue commands)
    └─► Phase 4 (Encoders — needs master output ring buffer)
    └─► Phase 5 (Scripting — needs all commands available for Lua API)
         └─► Phase 6 (Gateway — needs Phase 5 for live talk)
              └─► Phase 7 (Analytics — needs all phases feeding event logger)
```

Phases 3 and 4 can be worked on in parallel once Phase 1 is complete.  
Phase 5 can begin in parallel with Phase 4.

## Post-Phase Backlog

| Feature | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| True independent **Tempo** and **Pitch** (time-stretch + key lock, not shared rate slider) | High | 🟡 Planned |

Notes:
- Current engine exposes separate controls but both map to playback-rate, so they are intentionally unified in UI for now.
- Planned implementation is a dedicated time-stretch/pitch-shift DSP stage so tempo can change without changing musical key.

## Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Desktop framework | Tauri v2 (Rust + webview) | Low-latency local audio, ASIO/WASAPI, cross-platform |
| Audio I/O | CPAL 0.15 | Supports ASIO, WASAPI, CoreAudio, ALSA |
| Audio decode | Symphonia 0.5 | Pure Rust, MPL v2, no GPL taint, MP3/AAC/FLAC/OGG |
| DSP filters | biquad crate | Pure Rust, no GPL, standard biquad IIR |
| Ring buffers | ringbuf 0.4 | Lock-free SPSC, safe for real-time audio thread |
| Database (local) | sqlx + SQLite | Async, no server, cue points + config |
| Database (SAM) | sqlx + MySQL | Direct SAM schema read/write compatibility |
| Icecast streaming | Rust reqwest HTTP PUT | No Liquidsoap dependency on desktop |
| Scripting engine | mlua (Lua 5.4) | Lightweight, sandboxed, modern PAL replacement |
| MP3 encoding | lame-sys (LGPL) | Industry standard, dynamically linked = commercial OK |
| Mixxx code | ❌ Not used | GPL v2 — reimplemented all DSP from math/scratch |
| SAM PAL scripting | ❌ Deprecated | Replaced with Lua + mlua for modern extensibility |

## Project Management

- **ADO Project:** Minhaj Prayer Project
- **Assign work items to:** Minhaj Services (services@minhaj.work)
- **Use gemini-cli for:** tests, documentation, large-context code generation
- **Related project:** `../desizone-broadcast-engine` (NestJS + Next.js gateway — Phase 6 integration)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Dev mode
npm run tauri dev

# Rust compile check (fast, no window)
cd src-tauri && cargo check

# Run Rust tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test

# Build release
npm run tauri build
```

> **First `cargo build` takes 10–15 minutes** (Tauri + CPAL + Symphonia + sqlx + DSP crates from scratch). Subsequent builds are incremental.
